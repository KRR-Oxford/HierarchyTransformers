    r"""Class for the static hyperbolic embedding models:

        - [1] Poincaré Embedding by [Nickel et al., NeurIPS 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08039).
        - [2] Hyperbolic Entailment Cone by [Ganea et al., ICML 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01882).
        
    both of which lie in a unit Poincaré ball. According to [2], it is better to apply the entailment cone loss in the post-training phase of a Poincaré embedding model in [1].

    Attributes:
        entities (list): The list of input entity IDs (fixed).
        idx2ent (dict): A dictionary that stores the `(index, entity_id)` pairs.
        ent2idx (dict): A dictionary that stores the `(entity_id, index)` pairs.
        embed_dim (int): The embedding dimension of this model.
        manifold (geoopt.manifolds.PoincareBall): The hyperbolic manifold (Poincaré Ball) of this model.
