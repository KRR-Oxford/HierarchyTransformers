**News** ([changelog](docs/changelog.md)) :newspaper:

- [X] Under significant development to align with `sentence-transformers>=3.4.0.dev0` (**v0.1.0**).
- [X] Project page is now available ([click](https://krr-oxford.github.io/HierarchyTransformers/)).
- [X] Initial release (should work with `sentence-transformers<3.0.0` ) and bug fix. (**v0.0.3**)


## About

Hierarchy Transformer (HiT) is a framework that enables transformer encoder-based language models (LMs) to learn hierarchical structures in hyperbolic space. The main idea is to construct a PoincarÃ© ball that directly circumscribes the output embedding space of LMs,leveraging the exponential expansion of hyperbolic space to organise entity embeddings hierarchically. In addition to presenting this framework (see code on [GitHub](https://github.com/KRR-Oxford/HierarchyTransformers)), we are committed to training and releasing HiT models across various hierachiies. The models and datasets will be accessible on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/Hierarchy-Transformers/).

## Installation

### Main Dependencies

This repository follows a similar layout as the [`sentence-transformers`](https://www.sbert.net/index.html) library. The main model directly extends the sentence transformer architecture. We also utilise [`deeponto`](https://krr-oxford.github.io/DeepOnto/) for extracting hierarchies from source data and constructing datasets from hierarchies, and [`geoopt`](https://geoopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for arithmetic in hyperbolic space.

> The current release of `sentence-transformers=3.3.1` contains bugs during evaluation, which were fixed in their GitHub dev version `sentence-transformers=3.4.0.dev0`, please update the dependency manually until the official `3.4.0` is released.

### Install from PyPI

```bash
# requiring Python>=3.8
pip install hierarchy_transformers
```

### Install from GitHub

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/KRR-Oxford/HierarchyTransformers.git
```

## Huggingface Hub

Our HiT models and datasets are released on the [HuggingFace Hub](https://huggingface.co/Hierarchy-Transformers). 

### Get Started

```python
from hierarchy_transformers import HierarchyTransformer

# load the model
model = HierarchyTransformer.from_pretrained('Hierarchy-Transformers/HiT-MiniLM-L12-WordNetNoun')

# entity names to be encoded.
entity_names = ["computer", "personal computer", "fruit", "berry"]

# get the entity embeddings
entity_embeddings = model.encode(entity_names)
```

### Default Probing for Subsumption Prediction

Use the entity embeddings to predict the subsumption relationships between them.

```python
# suppose we want to compare "personal computer" and "computer", "berry" and "fruit"
child_entity_embeddings = model.encode(["personal computer", "berry"], convert_to_tensor=True)
parent_entity_embeddings = model.encode(["computer", "fruit"], convert_to_tensor=True)

# compute the hyperbolic distances and norms of entity embeddings
dists = model.manifold.dist(child_entity_embeddings, parent_entity_embeddings)
child_norms = model.manifold.dist0(child_entity_embeddings)
parent_norms = model.manifold.dist0(parent_entity_embeddings)

# use the empirical function for subsumption prediction proposed in the paper
# `centri_score_weight` and the overall threshold are determined on the validation set
subsumption_scores = - (dists + centri_score_weight * (parent_norms - child_norms))
```

### Train Your Own Models

Use the example scripts in our [repository](https://github.com/KRR-Oxford/HierarchyTransformers/tree/main/scripts) to reproduce existing models and train/evaluate your own models.
